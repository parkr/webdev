[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/parkr/webdev.png?branch=gh-pages)](https://travis-ci.org/parkr/webdev)

## Credit

I mean it's just a collection of stuff [Parker Moore](http://parkermoore.de)
compiled. The actual stuff will have links to the source website - that should
provide some info on who is actually to blame for such awesomeness.

Uses [gridism by @cobyism][] and [@mojombo's syntax.css][] (the latter with slight modifications).
